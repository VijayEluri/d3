 D3 : Dynamic and Decentralized Distribution
=======================================================================

Main Concepts
=======================================================================

The distribution environment is seen as a set of agencies, with all
the same hierarchical status. Each agency is composed of actors which
can do some job, communicate through the network, migrate from one
agency to another... Agency is the main actor and controls all other.


Actors
=======================================================================

There are several types of actor and each one has its own
specifications:

- Agency
- Feature
- Protocol
- Entity

Agency is the main type of actor. There is only one agency by
runtime. It allows the deployment of D3 and the control of other
actors. Features allow to extend features provide by the agency.
