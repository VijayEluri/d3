============================
 IdentifiableObject Concept
============================

Identifiable objects are composed of :
- a type (agency,feature,entity,...)
- a full path
- an host

The full path of each object is composed of a path defined for
the class of the object, and an id unique for each instances.
Class-path can be defined with the IdentifiableObjectPath annotation.

Each identifiable object can be represented by the following URI :
	
	type://host/path/id

Some methods of an identifiable object can be annotated as
'RequestAccessible'. In such case, these methods can be executed
with the following URI:

	type://host/path/id?callable=name_of_the_callable
